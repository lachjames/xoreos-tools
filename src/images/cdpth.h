 *  Sonic, used as depth information for the area background images.
 *
 *  Layout-wise, a CDPTH is stored similar to CBGT: cells of 64x64
 *  pixels, compressed using Nintendo's 0x10 LZSS algorithm. Unlike
 *  CBGT, though, the cells themselves are *not* swizzled into 8x8
 *  tiles, and the pixel value in CDPTH is a 16bit integer specifying
 *  a depth.
 *
 *  The width and height of the final image is not stored within the
 *  CDPTH file, and has to be provided from the outside, like from
 *  the dimensions of the CBGT image, the dimensions of the 2DA file
 *  for the CBGT image, or the relevant values found in areas.gda.
