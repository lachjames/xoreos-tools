/** Image decoder for Nintendo's tile-based graphics format.
 *
 *  2D graphics on the Nintendo DS is fundamentally tile-based.
 *  Specifically, the graphics data in NCGR is ordered in tiles of 8x8
 *  pixels. We unwrap them, so this is transparent to the user of the
 *  NCGR class.
 *
 *  Moreover, an NCGR file can itself be a tile of a larger image.
 *  By specifying a vector of NCGR streams and the dimensions of the
 *  grid they span (in NCGR files, not pixels), the NCGR class can
 *  automatically stitch them together into a single big image.
 *
 *  If a pointer in the NCGR stream vector is 0, the cell in the grid
 *  will stay empty, filled with entry 0 of the palette.
 *
 *  Please note that, in accordance with other image decoder classes,
 *  NCGR will never take over any of the streams. The caller has to
 *  manage stream deletion itself.
