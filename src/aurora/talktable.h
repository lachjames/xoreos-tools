 *  A talk table contains localized string data, and optional voice-
 *  over resource names, indexed by a string reference ("StrRef").
 *
 *  A single talktable always contains strings in a single language
 *  (and for a single gender of the PC), and commonly all strings for
 *  a given context (module, campaign, ...).
 *
 *  See classes TalkTable_TLK and TalkTable_GFF for the two main
 *  formats a talk table can be found in.
