	 * end of the list. The resource index is always one chunk, and at
	 * the end, there's the usual 16 bytes. For the resource index, the
	 * first four of those is the offset of that start of the chunk, and
	 * the next four bytes are 0x00. We can use that to figure out end.

	 * With that full range, we can decompress the resource index and
