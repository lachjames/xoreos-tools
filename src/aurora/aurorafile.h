/** Base class for most files found in games using BioWare's Aurora engine.
 *
 *  Aurora files generally start with a 4-byte human-readable ID, for example
 *  'ERF ', followed by a 4-byte version string, like 'V1.0'. This base class
 *  reads them as big-endian 32-bit integer values. See the MKTAG() macro, as
 *  defined in src/common/endianness.h, for generating values to compare the
 *  IDs read out of a stream against.
 *
 *  Later games encode these ID and version values as 8-byte, little-endian
 *  UTF-16 strings instead. We automatically detect this, convert them back
 *  into the old format, and set a flag that can be queried with the method
 *  isUTF16LE().
 *
 *  Alternatively, AuroraFile provides static methods for reading the base
 *  header out of a stream.
